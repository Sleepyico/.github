Please label your issues appropriately.

Please read the `Repository Discussions` and the `Rules & Guidelines` before starting a discussion!

## Submitting a bug report

Issues should be used to report bugs. If you have found a bug, check to see if it has already been reported or resolved. If it hasn't, you can `create a new issue` using the "Bug report" template. Please include as much information as possible in your report.

## Submitting a feature request

To request a new feature for the project, ask us on discord and submit an idea.

If you would like to request changes to an existing feature, it may be better to `create an issue` instead (use the `given labels` and read their descriptions).

## Creating a pull request

To edit the documentation, translate, or contribute code to this project, you will need to `create a new pull request`. For large changes, you should **consider creating an issue** (or commenting on an existing one) first, as it could save you some time.


### Contributing code

Any code changes should be accompanied by any necessary documentation changes.

**You should install the ESLint extension in your editor** to help you follow the code style.

- Indentation should use tabs not spaces
- Classes should be named in PascalCase
- Functions should be named in camelCase
- Variables and constants should be named in snake_case
- Use the latest JS features (destructuring, arrow functions etc)

### Translating

Please try to keep the meaning of the translation as close to the original as possible. If you want to change the meaning, you can customise your locale files after.
