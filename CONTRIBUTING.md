First off, **thank you** for considering contributing to my projects! Your time and effort are appreciated. 💖

Before contributing, please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which all contributors must follow.

You don’t need to write code to contribute — **all contributions are welcome!**

If you want to contribute but don’t know how, and this file doesn’t answer your questions, **start a discussion** or [join our Discord community](https://iconical.dev/discord) to ask for guidance.

## 🐛 Submitting a Bug Report

Bugs should be reported using GitHub Issues. Before submitting:
- **Check** if the bug has already been reported or fixed.
- If it hasn’t, **create a new issue** using the *Bug Report* template.
- Provide **as much detail as possible**—include logs, screenshots, and steps to reproduce the bug.

---

## ✨ Submitting a Feature Request

Want to suggest a new feature? You can:
- **Ask me on Discord** and discuss your idea.
- **Submit a GitHub Issue** with the appropriate label.
- If it’s a small change to an existing feature, consider **opening an issue** instead.

Use the **Feature Request** template when submitting ideas!

## 🔄 Creating a Pull Request

To edit the documentation, translate, or contribute code, you need to **create a new pull request (PR)**. For large changes, consider **creating an issue first** to discuss it before you start coding.

### 🛠️ Contributing Code

- Follow project coding guidelines.
- **Install ESLint** (if applicable) to maintain code consistency.
- **Code style:**
  - Use **tabs**, not spaces, for indentation.
  - Class names should be **PascalCase**.
  - Function names should be **camelCase**.
  - Variables/constants should be **snake_case**.
  - Use **modern JavaScript/TypeScript features** (destructuring, arrow functions, etc.).
- Any code changes **must** include relevant documentation updates.

### 🌎 Translating

- Keep translations **as close to the original meaning as possible**.
- If modifications are necessary, users can customize their locale files later.

### 🧪 Testing Your Changes
- Run tests locally before submitting a PR.
- If adding a feature, **write tests** to cover it.
- Use the following command to run tests:
