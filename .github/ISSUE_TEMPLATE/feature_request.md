## 💡 Feature Description
**What amazing thing should we add?**

<!-- Example: "An AI assistant that predicts my future financial mistakes so I can ignore them in advance." -->

## 🤔 Why Is This Needed?
**How will this feature make life better?**

<!-- Example: "Because manually tracking my budget is hard, and I’d rather have an AI tell me I’m broke instead of figuring it out myself." -->

## 🎯 Expected Outcome
**How should this feature work?**

<!-- Example: "Every time I overspend, the app should flash a warning saying 'Congratulations, you’ve unlocked debt!'" -->

## 🛠️ Possible Implementation
**Got any ideas on how we could make this real?**

<!-- Example: "Integrate an AI model that detects irresponsible spending patterns and plays a sad trombone sound when it happens." -->

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered
**Are there other ways to achieve this?**

<!-- Example: "Instead of an AI assistant, we could just have a pop-up that says 'Are you sure you need that?' every time I buy something unnecessary." -->

## 📸 Mockups/Screenshots
**Visuals? Sketches? Fancy diagrams?**

<!-- Example: "Here’s a totally professional drawing I made in MS Paint to illustrate my genius idea :)" -->

## ℹ️ Additional Context
**Anything else we should know?**

<!-- Example: "I think this feature will make the app at least 9000% better, but I could be slightly biased 💀" -->
